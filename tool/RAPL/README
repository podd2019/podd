RaplSetPower: 
#RaplSetPower is able to set power limit seprately for each socket/chip
./RaplSetPower 100 100 #setting both chip to 100W limit
./RaplSetPower 100 0 #set chip 0 to 100W and keep chip 1 power unchanged

RaplPowerMonitor:
./RaplPowerMonitor_1s # Monitor the on-chip power of both sockets of the interval 1s and write(append) the power data into txt file.

RaplPowerMonitor_1s_serverID:
./RaplPowerMonitor_1s_serverID # Monitor the on-chip power of both sockets of the interval 1s and write(append) the power data into txt file, which is identified by the serverID.
